## Why

This guide exists so that I can use it to train individuals
who either _already are_ or _will be_ programming in Go.

Since 2013, I have helped a number of individuals, at different
skill and experience levels, learn Go.

And have helped these same individuals figure out how to use Go
to solve certain kinds of problems.

I have made this guide public, so if other individuals out there
find utility in this guide, that's great! ðŸ™‚

## "Go" versus "Golang"

If you are just starting to get into Go, you may have noticed the word "Golang"
used sometimes.

To clear up any potentia confusion, "Go" and "Golang" are the exact same thing!

Officially, the programming language is named "Go".

But many many individuals refer to it "Golang".

(If you are curious what I typically do, I tend to usually say "Go" and write "Golang".
Although in this guide I'm trying to write "Go" more than I do normally.)

(If you are trying to find information on it in a search engine, my experience is that using
"golang" seems to work better.)
