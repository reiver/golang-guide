# Golang Guide

Welcome to the **Golang Guide**.

## Why

This guide exists so that I can use it to train individuals
who either _already are_ or _will be_ programming in Go.

Since 2013, I have helped a number of individuals, at different
skill and experience levels, learn Go.

And have helped these same individuals figure out how to use Go
to solve certain kinds of problems.

If other individuals out there find utility in this guide, that's great! ðŸ™‚
